    <title>User Federation SPI and LDAP/AD Integration</title>
    <para>
        Keycloak can federate external user databases.  Out of the box we have support for LDAP and Active Directory.
        Before you dive into this, you should understand how Keycloak does federation.
    </para>
    <para>
        Keycloak performs federation a bit differently than other products/projects.  The vision of Keycloak is that it
        is an out of the box solution that should provide a core set of feature irregardless of the backend user storage you
        want to use.  Because of this requirement/vision, Keycloak has a set data model that all of its services use.
        Most of the time when you want to federate an external user store, much of the metadata that would be needed to
        provide this complete feature set does not exist in that external store.  For example your LDAP server may only
        provide password validation, but not support TOTP or user role mappings.  The Keycloak User Federation SPI was
        written to support these completely variable configurations.
    </para>
    <para>
        The way user federation works is that Keycloak will import your federated users on demand to its local storage.  How
        much metadata that is imported depends on the underlying federation plugin and how that plugin is configured.  Some
        federation plugins may only import the username into Keycloak storage, others might import everything from name,
        address, and phone number, to user role mappings.  Some plugins might want to import credentials directly into
        Keycloak storage and let Keycloak handle credential validation.  Others might want to handle credential validation
        themselves.  The goal of the Federation SPI is to support all of these scenarios.

        <title>LDAP and Active Directory Plugin</title>
        <para>
            Keycloak comes with a built-in LDAP/AD plugin.  By default, it is set up only to import username, email, first and last name, but you are free
            to configure <link linkend='ldap_mappers'>mappers</link> and add more attributes or delete default ones.
            It supports password validation via LDAP/AD protocols and different user metadata synchronization modes.  To configure
            a federated LDAP store go to the admin console.  Click on the <literal>Users</literal> menu option to get you
            to the user management page.  Then click on the <literal>Federation</literal> submenu option.  When
            you get to this page there is an "Add Provider" select box.  You should see "ldap" within this list.  Selecting
            "ldap" will bring you to the ldap configuration page.

            <title>Edit Mode</title>

                Edit mode defines various synchronization options with your LDAP store depending on what privileges
                you have.

                                anytime anybody tries to update these fields.  Also, password updates will not be supported.

        <title>Sync of LDAP users to Keycloak</title>
        <para>
            LDAP Federation Provider will automatically take care of synchronization (import) of needed LDAP users into Keycloak database.
            For example once you first authenticate LDAP user <literal>john</literal> from Keycloak UI, LDAP Federation provider will
            first import this LDAP user into Keycloak database and then authenticate against LDAP password.
        </para>
        <para>
            Federation Provider imports just requested users by default, so if you click to <literal>View all users</literal>
            in Keycloak admin console, you will see just those LDAP users, which were already authenticated/requested by Keycloak.
        </para>
        <para>If you want to sync all LDAP users into Keycloak database, you may configure and enable Sync, which is in
            admin console on same page like the configuration of Federation provider itself. There are 2 types of sync:
            <variablelist>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>Full sync</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            This will synchronize all LDAP users into Keycloak DB. Those LDAP users, which already exist in Keycloak and were
                            changed in LDAP directly will be updated in Keycloak DB (For example if user <literal>Mary Kelly</literal> was changed in LDAP to <literal>Mary Doe</literal>).
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>Changed users sync</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            This will check LDAP and it will sync into Keycloak just those users, which were created or updated in LDAP from the time of last sync.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
            </variablelist>
        </para>
        <para>
            In usual cases you may want to trigger full sync at the beginning, so you will import all LDAP users to Keycloak just once. Then you may setup
            periodic sync of changed users, so Keycloak will periodically ask LDAP server for newly created or updated users and backport them to Keycloak DB.
            Also you may want to trigger full sync again after some longer time or setup periodic full sync as well.
        </para>
        <para>In admin console, you can trigger sync directly or you can enable periodic changed or full sync.</para>

    <section id="ldap_mappers">
        <title>LDAP/Federation mappers</title>
        <para>
            LDAP mappers are <literal>listeners</literal>, which are triggered by LDAP Federation provider at various points and provide
            another extension point to LDAP integration. They are triggered during import LDAP user into Keycloak, registration Keycloak user back to LDAP or when querying LDAP user from Keycloak.
            When you create LDAP Federation provider, Keycloak will automatically provide set of builtin <literal>mappers</literal> for this provider.
            You are free to change this set and create new mapper or update/delete existing ones.
        </para>
        <para>
            By default, we have those implementation of LDAP federation mapper:
            <variablelist>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>User Attribute Mapper</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            This allows to specify which LDAP attribute is mapped to which attribute of Keycloak User. So for example you can configure
                            that LDAP attribute <literal>mail</literal> is supposed to be mapped to the UserModel attribute <literal>email</literal> in Keycloak database.
                            For this mapper implementation, there is always one-to-one mapping (one LDAP attribute mapped to one Keycloak UserModel attribute)

                        <para>
                            This allows to specify that fullname of user, which is saved in some LDAP attribute (usualy <literal>cn</literal> ) will be mapped to
                            <literal>firstName</literal> and <literal>lastname</literal> attributes of UserModel. Having <literal>cn</literal> to contain full name of user
                            is common case for some LDAP deployments.

                        <para>
                            This allows to configure role mappings from LDAP into Keycloak role mappings. One Role mapper can be used to map LDAP roles
                            (usually groups from particular branch of LDAP tree) into roles corresponding to either realm roles or client roles of specified client.
                            It's not a problem to configure more Role mappers for same LDAP provider. So for example you can specify that role mappings from groups under
                            <literal>ou=main,dc=example,dc=org</literal> will be mapped to realm role mappings and role mappings from
                            groups under <literal>ou=finance,dc=example,dc=org</literal> will be mapped to client role mappings of client <literal>finance</literal> .

                            This allows to configure group mappings from LDAP into Keycloak group mappings. Group mapper can be used to map LDAP groups from particular branch of LDAP tree
                            into groups in Keycloak. And it will also propagate user-group mappings from LDAP into user-group mappings in Keycloak.

                        <para>
                            You can choose to preserve group inheritance from LDAP as well, but this may fail as Keycloak inheritance is more restrictive than LDAP
                            (For example in Keycloak each group can have just one parent and there is no recursion allowed. In LDAP the recursion is possible and every group can be member of more
                            other groups too).

                        <para>
                            As of now, the mapper doesn't provide mapping of LDAP roles-groups to Keycloak roles-groups
                            (For example when LDAP group <literal>cn=role1,ou=roles,dc=example,dc=com</literal> is member of LDAP group
                            <literal>cn=group1,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com</literal> , we don't support the mapping of Keycloak role <literal>role1</literal> imported from LDAP to corresponding Keycloak group <literal>group1</literal> imported from LDAP).

                            Mapper specific to Microsoft Active Directory (MSAD). It's able to tightly integrate the MSAD user account state into Keycloak account state (account enabled, password is expired etc).
                            It's using <literal>userAccountControl</literal> and <literal>pwdLastSet</literal> LDAP attributes for that (both are specific to MSAD and are not LDAP standard).
                            For example if pwdLastSet is 0, the Keycloak user is required to update password (there will be UPDATE_PASSWORD required action added to him in Keycloak). Or if userAccountControl
                            is 514 (disabled account) the Keycloak user is disabled as well etc.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            For writable LDAP, the mapping is bi-directional and the state from Keycloak is propagated to LDAP (For example enable user
                            in Keycloak admin console will update the value of userAccountControl in MSAD and effectively enable him in MSAD as well).
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            For writable LDAPs, mapper also provides mapping of error codes during MSAD user authentication to the
                            appropriate action in Keycloak. For example if MSAD user authentication fails due to the fact, that MSAD password is expired,
                            the mapper will allow user to authenticate into Keycloak, but it will add UPDATE_PASSWORD required action to the user, so user
                            must update his password.

        <para>By default, there is set of User Attribute mappers to map basic UserModel attributes username, first name, lastname and email to corresponding LDAP attributes. You are free to extend this and provide
            more attribute mappings (For example to street, postalCode etc), delete firstName/lastname mapper and put fullName mapper instead, add role mappers etc.
            Admin console provides tooltips, which should help on how to configure corresponding mappers.

            a simple properties file.  See <literal>examples/providers/federation-provider</literal>.  Most of how
            to create a federation provider is explained directly within the example code, but some information is here too.

            Writing a User Federation Provider starts by implementing the <literal>UserFederationProvider</literal>
            and <literal>UserFederationProviderFactory</literal> interfaces.  Please see the Javadoc and example
            for complete details on how to do this.  Some important methods of note:
            getUserByUsername() and getUserByEmail() require that you query your federated storage and if the user exists
            create and import the user into Keycloak storage.  How much metadata you import is fully up to you.  This
            import is done by invoking methods on the object returned <literal>KeycloakSession.userStorage()</literal>
            to add and import user information.  The proxy() method will be called whenever Keycloak has found an imported
            UserModel.  This allows the federation provider to proxy the UserModel which is useful if you want to support
            external storage updates on demand.

            After your code is written you must package up all your classes within a JAR file.  This jar file must
            contain a file called <literal>org.keycloak.models.UserFederationProviderFactory</literal>
            within the <literal>META-INF/services</literal> directory of the JAR.  This file is a list
            of fully qualified classnames of all implementations of <literal>UserFederationProviderFactory</literal>.
            For more details on writing provider implementations and how to deploy to Keycloak refer to the
            <link linkend='providers'>providers</link> section.
