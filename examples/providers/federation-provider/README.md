Example User Federation Provider
===================================================

This is an example of user federation backed by a simple properties file.  This properties file only contains username/password
key pairs.  To deploy, build this directory then take the jar and copy it to providers directory. Alternatively you can deploy as a module by running:

    KEYCLOAK_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --command="module add --name=org.keycloak.examples.userprops --resources=target/federation-properties-example.jar --dependencies=org.keycloak.keycloak-core,org.keycloak.keycloak-server-spi,org.keycloak.keycloak-server-spi-private"

Then registering the provider by editing `standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` and adding the module to the providers element:

    <providers>
        ...
        <provider>module:org.keycloak.examples.userprops</provider>
    </providers>
  
You will then have to restart the authentication server.

The ClasspathPropertiesFederationProvider is an example of a readonly provider.  If you go to the Users/Federation
  page of the admin console you will see this provider listed under "classpath-properties.  To configure this provider you 
specify a classpath to a properties file in the "path" field of the admin page for this plugin.  This example includes
a "test-users.properties" within the JAR that you can use as the variable.
  
The FilePropertiesFederationProvider is an example of a writable provider.  It synchronizes changes made to
username and password with the properties file.  If you go to the Users/Federation page of the admin console you will 
see this provider listed under "file-properties".  To configure this provider you specify a fully qualified file path to 
a properties file in the "path" field of the admin page for this plugin.
